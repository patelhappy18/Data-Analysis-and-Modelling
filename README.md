# DS_Project

It is an introductory project of the Data Science.

One of the main objectives of this project is to develop hands-on experience in analyzing complex data and building machine learning models. 
In this project, I used a dataset from the open data portals to build at least two machine learning models, and comapre their performance using various factors of evalution matrix from the sklearn module of Python.


## Task Performed:
1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Model training
3. Testing and Evaluation
4. Comparison and Conclusion


The deatiled explanation and coding techniques can be seen in the code file posted.
